## History

After reading [Flow-based Programming](http://www.jpaulmorrison.com/fbp/) in 2013, i was fascinated by the concept. 
I wanted to build a version which is suited to make user interfaces, even there are a lot of comments which say FBP is not suited to build UIs. I tried a lot of variants (with [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), [terrificjs](http://www.terrifically.org/), [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/),... ) and was not successful, until i came across Polymer.
